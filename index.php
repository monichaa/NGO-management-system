                        A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a non-profit group that functions independently of any government. 
                        NGOs, sometimes called civil societies, are organized on community, national and international levels to 
                        serve a social or political goal such as humanitarian causes or the environment.
                        
                        While "NGO" has various interpretations, the term is generally accepted to include non-profit, private 
                        organizations that operate outside of government control.
                        Some NGOs rely primarily on volunteers, while others support a paid staff.
                         The World Bank identifies two broad groups of NGOs:
                        Operational NGOs, which focus on the design and implementation of development projects.
                        Advocacy NGOs, which defend or promote a specific cause and seek to influence public policy.
                        
                        Some NGOs may fall under both categories simultaneously. Examples of NGOs include those that
                         support human rights, advocate for improved health or encourage political participation.
